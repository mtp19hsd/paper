# Abstract

A consise summary of our work and findings.

# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.
Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).
Jones et all (1998) considered several measurements but continental scale measurements have not previously been made.

# Motivation
Find out more about this important phemonenon.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported away from the source region.

# Methodology
We compared our measurements of particle ageing with a model simulation. The model is detailed in Smith et al (2002).

# Results 
The simulations indicate that coagulation is the dimonant growth mechanism for these particles.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the BBOA ageing process.
Nonetheless questions remain unanswered, so more funding is required.
